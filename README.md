We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 






## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-gcp-kms/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Default KMS
```hcl
module "kms_key" {

  source = "clouddrove/kms/google"
  version     = "1.0.0"

  environment = var.environment
  label_order = var.label_order

  prevent_destroy                           = false      # when prevent_destroy is true (long-lived key) # when prevent_destroy is false (short-lived key)
  google_kms_crypto_key_iam_binding_enabled = true
  project_id                                = var.gcp_project_id
  location                                  = var.location
  keys                                      = ["dev"]    # add key names in list
  service_accounts                          = ["serviceAccount:service-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.gserviceaccount.com"]
  role                                      = "roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter"
}
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| environment | Environment name | `string` | `"dev"` | no |
| google\_kms\_crypto\_key\_iam\_binding\_enabled | (Optional) Whether or not to create IAM bindings for the Google Cloud KMS crypto key within the module. Set to true to include IAM bindings, false to exclude them. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| key\_algorithm | The algorithm to use when creating a version based on this template. See the https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/CryptoKeyVersionAlgorithm for possible inputs. | `string` | `"GOOGLE_SYMMETRIC_ENCRYPTION"` | no |
| key\_protection\_level | The protection level to use when creating a version based on this template. Default value: "SOFTWARE" Possible values: ["SOFTWARE", "HSM"] | `string` | `"SOFTWARE"` | no |
| key\_rotation\_period | specifies the duration, expressed in seconds, for the automatic rotation of cryptographic keys | `string` | `null` | no |
| keyring | Keyring name. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| keys | Key names. | `list(string)` | <pre>[<br>  "KMS-KEY"<br>]</pre> | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | <pre>[<br>  "name",<br>  "environment"<br>]</pre> | no |
| location | Location for the keyring. | `string` | `""` | no |
| module\_enabled | (Optional) Whether or not to create resources within the module. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| prevent\_destroy | Set the prevent\_destroy lifecycle attribute on keys. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| project\_id | (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it is not set, the provider project is used. | `string` | `null` | no |
| purpose | The immutable purpose of the CryptoKey. Possible values are ENCRYPT\_DECRYPT, ASYMMETRIC\_SIGN, and ASYMMETRIC\_DECRYPT. | `string` | `"ENCRYPT_DECRYPT"` | no |
| role | this role use for permissions | `string` | `"roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter"` | no |
| service\_accounts | List of comma-separated owners for each key declared in set\_owners\_for. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| key | n/a |
| keyring | Self link of the keyring. |
| keyring\_name | Name of the keyring. |
| keyring\_resource | Keyring resource. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
