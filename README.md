We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-gcp-kms/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Default KMS
```hcl
module "kms_key" {

  source = "../../"

  environment = "dev"
  label_order = ["environment", "name"]

  google_kms_crypto_key_iam_binding_enabled = true
  project_id                                = "clouddrove"
  prevent_destroy                           = false
  keyring                                   = "test-keyring"
  location                                  = "us-east1"
  keys                                      = ["KMS1"]
  service_accounts                          = ["serviceAccount:example@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"]
  role                                      = "roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter" # add required roles here
}
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| environment | Environment name | `string` | `"dev"` | no |
| key\_algorithm | The algorithm to use when creating a version based on this template. See the https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/CryptoKeyVersionAlgorithm for possible inputs. | `string` | `"GOOGLE_SYMMETRIC_ENCRYPTION"` | no |
| key\_protection\_level | The protection level to use when creating a version based on this template. Default value: "SOFTWARE" Possible values: ["SOFTWARE", "HSM"] | `string` | `"SOFTWARE"` | no |
| key\_rotation\_period | n/a | `string` | `"100000s"` | no |
| keyring | Keyring name. | `string` | `""` | no |
| keys | Key names. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | <pre>[<br>  "name",<br>  "environment"<br>]</pre> | no |
| location | Location for the keyring. | `string` | `""` | no |
| module\_enabled | (Optional) Whether or not to create resources within the module. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| name | (Optional) The name of the VPC. The name will be used to prefix all associacted resources also. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression "[a-z]([-a-z0-9]\*[a-z0-9])?" which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. Default is "main". | `string` | `""` | no |
| prevent\_destroy | Set the prevent\_destroy lifecycle attribute on keys. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| project\_id | (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it is not set, the provider project is used. | `string` | `null` | no |
| purpose | The immutable purpose of the CryptoKey. Possible values are ENCRYPT\_DECRYPT, ASYMMETRIC\_SIGN, and ASYMMETRIC\_DECRYPT. | `string` | `"ENCRYPT_DECRYPT"` | no |
| role | this role use for permissions | `string` | `"roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter"` | no |
| service\_accounts | List of comma-separated owners for each key declared in set\_owners\_for. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| key | n/a |
| keyring | Self link of the keyring. |
| keyring\_name | Name of the keyring. |
| keyring\_resource | Keyring resource. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
